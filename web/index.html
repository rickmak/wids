        MongoDB has builtin replication support for high availability and
        redundancy. In this session we will review the basic concepts around
        replica sets, and how they provide automated failover and recovery of
        nodes. The talk will also cover how replica sets allow maintenance
        without down time, and how it helps your application's performance.
        Additional topics about replication internals, elections and dynamic
        reads will also be introduced.

        g0v.tw 是一個推動資訊透明化的社群，致力於開發公民參與社會的資訊平台與工具。將 gov 以「零」替代成為
        g0v，從零重新思考政府的角色，也是代表數位原生世代從 0 與 1 世界的視野。g0v.tw
        以開放原始碼的精神為基底，關心言論自由、資訊開放，寫程式提供公民容易使用的資訊服務。資訊的透明化能幫助公民更確實了解政府運作、更快速了解議題，不被媒體壟斷，也才可有效監督政府，化為參與行動最終深化民主體質。
      </p>
      <p>
        g0v.tw is an online community that advocates information transparency,
        focusing on developing information platform and tools for citizens to
        participate in our society. Substituting the “o” with “0″ in gov, the
        new “g0v” not only stands for rethinking the role that the government
        plays from the bottom up, but also represents the world view of 0 and
        1 in the digital natives generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on the open-source spirit, g0v.tw is involved in freedom of
        speech and information by providing citizens information services that
        are easy to use.  Information transparency helps citizens better
        understand public issues and how the government works, allowing
        citizens to make more informed judgments that are not based solely on
        mass media, participate in governance, and ultimately build a more
        democratic society.

        In 2013 Firefox OS launched globally in multiple countries with multiple partners.  While Firefox OS will continue to expand to different smartphone price points and markets, many new industries have shown interest in the open source OS.  With the web as the common platform, these new devices using Firefox OS will be able to enable a large ecosystem of web developers that previously did not have easy access to hardware features.  This session will touch on some exciting new developments that Mozilla is working on, as well as a vision of things to come.

        The cloud is a programmable datacenter. It gives developers programmatic control over the infrastructure required to run their applications throughout their lifecycle - from development and testing, to scalable and highly available production deployments. Besides low-level primitives such as compute, storage and networking, the cloud can also provide higher level useful services such databases. This enables you to follow Service Oriented Architecture principles, and focus on developing your differentiating application features. Join this session to see live demonstrations of Infrastructure as Code in action, as well as how to focus on your app development by automating the rest of the system. This session will also introduce the new skills available for interacting with cloud resources directly from your code.
