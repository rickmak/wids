        With over 225 million professional members across 200 countries and territories, LinkedIn’s mission
        is to connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful.  Data drives
        this objective as we leverage the enormous amounts of complex information flowing through our
        ecosystem to surface personalized insights and opportunities to our members. In doing so, we are able
        to help professionals make informed decisions that make them great at the jobs they are in, and also
        help them on their journey to fulfill their professional aspirations. We learn a vast amount from our
        members, and this rich professional data serves as the launching pad for personalized products,
        features, designs and new services that help our members be great at what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most important elements in bringing data-driven experiences to our members, is ensuring
        that it provides value and continues to do so throughout their career. As new members continue to
        join the site at a rate faster than two per second, building a scalable infrastructure and shared
        community across our organization is key to ensuring we continue to evolve as our members evolve.
        As LinkedIn continues to grow, the underlying infrastructure continuously face scalability challenges.
        How are we handling these challenges?  Come and find out about the evolution of LinkedIn's data
        infrastructure technologies.

        Twitter's Network Digest are highly personalized emails that go to users and show them the best
        tweets from their network that they missed on Twitter.  There's multiple systems involved in both
        figuring out what the best tweets for any given user is (all 200+ million of them) and then in
        generating the unique messages and sending them.

        The performance and the lack of development resources have always been the most doubtful
        facts of running demanding 3D games on the web. The wish to build a 3D game engine and to
        run commercial 3D games on the web take enormous time &amp; money. Hence the technologies that
        can bridge the web and the existing native libraries/applications become more desirable.
        In this talk, a platform that solve this issue to bridge the gap between web and native
        will be introduced. This platform is comprised of technologies that are either standard-based
        or aiming at standards which will allow those high-end 3D games to be distributed
        more easily and more cost-effectively than ever.

        Since the launch of Google Maps in 2005, we have been enjoying the convenience brought
        by the map. With the StreetView function launched, we can even browse the world without
        stepping outside. The Google Maps API has been launched for developers to leverage the
        beauty of Google Maps and put it in different applications. The instructor will first give
        a brief introduction to Google Maps history and features. He will also talk about the
        principles of the Google Maps API and compare the differences between versions. Students
        shall have hands-on exercise to overlay their own floor plans and StreetView imagery with
        the help of the Google Maps API. The instructor will also give tips and tricks while using
        the Google Maps API.

        along their laptops to get their development environment set up. Join and get a chance to receive
        the BlackBerry Developer Prototype device (Dev Alpha B) to test your apps on a real device before
